# Javascript Journey Notes
The goal of this section is to record breakthroughs in my logic understanding, while following a learning process that helps me absorb the logic. 

Currently, I've gotten stuck at certain points within two different javascript learning platforms, so this is my calculated attempt to resolve that hinderance. 

### Learning Process
1. Order to Learn New Subjects
   - Go through a topic on Andrei Udemy Course; i.e. 'Arrays'
     - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery
   - Go through the same topic on 2 other learning sites (fill these in once I determine best)
       - If logic is still not clear, continue to go through other learning sites
   - Go through logic exercises on saved sites
   - Look for small project where I can implement what I learned
   - Note the logic in my notes
2. Active Process of Writing Code:
   - Write down logic in english
   - Break down logic into small steps of code
   - console.log every step of the way to make sure it works
   - Write detailed comments on each section of code while learning
