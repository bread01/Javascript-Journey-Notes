# Javascript Journey Notes
The goal of this section is to record breakthroughs in my logic understanding, while following a learning process that helps me absorb the logic. 

Currently, I've gotten stuck at certain points within two different javascript learning platforms, so this is my calculated attempt to resolve that hinderance. 

### Learning Process
1. ***Order to Learn New Subjects***
   - Go through a topic on Andrei Udemy Course; i.e. 'Arrays'
     - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery
   - Go through the same topic on 2 other learning sites (fill these in once I determine best)
       - If logic is still not clear, continue to go through other learning sites
   - Go through logic exercises on saved sites
   - Look for small project where I can implement what I learned
   - Note the logic in my notes
2. ***Active Process of Writing Code***
   - Write down logic in english
   - Break down logic into small steps of code
   - console.log every step of the way to make sure it works
   - Write detailed comments on each section of code while learning

### Section 1 - Comparisons and Variables
Overall what I learned, with code example

Key Comparisons and Math: 
```
=== is 'does A equal to B'; true or false?
!== is 'does A not equal to B'; true or false?
++ is an increment +1
-- is a decrement -1
** puts variable to the power of second operator
% is a remainder of division calculation
```

Key Operators:
```
'&&' means And
  - '(x < 10 && y > 1) is true
'||' means Or
  - '(x === 5 || y === 5) is false'
'!' means Not
  - '!(x === y) is true'
```

Key Syntax for Variables:
With ES6, use 'let' and 'const' instead of 'var'
```
let <variable name> = "output text" + "something";
don't forget to call the variable name for its output
```

Variables:
```
Number(stringName) - Change a string into a number
prompt("displayText") - popup prompt to enter value
alert("displayText") - popup alert to display text

ex: let first = prompt("enter first number");
this stores the entered prompt value into the variable 'first'
```
